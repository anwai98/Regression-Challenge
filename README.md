# Regression-Challenge
Regression Problem on the Given Dataset using Parametric and Non Parametric Approach in R Programming Language

How to play with the code?

1. Download RStudio and the necessary R Environments.
2. If Step 1 doesn't work, don't panic. Download WebStorm/VSCode, get the requisite packages, and enjoy (this worked for me atleast).
3. Play with the straight forward code.
